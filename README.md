A comprehensive **data engineering and analytics project** analyzing IPL cricket data using **Apache Spark on Databricks**. This project demonstrates advanced data processing, SQL analytics, and visualization skills, handling a dataset of **2.5+ million rows** stored in an **AWS S3 bucket**.

---

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes **15+ years of IPL match data** to uncover insights about player performance, team strategies, and match dynamics. Built with **PySpark on Databricks**, it includes:
- **ETL pipelines** for processing raw CSV data stored in AWS S3
- Advanced Spark operations (Aggregations, Window Functions, Joins)
- SQL-based analytical queries
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Data quality checks, schema enforcement, and optimization

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Apache Spark 3.5.4** (PySpark API)
- **Databricks** (Notebook Environment)
- **AWS S3** (Data Storage)
- **Python 3.13**
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Spark SQL** (Analytical Queries)

## üìÇ Datasets
The dataset, sourced from **Sportskeeda**, includes:
1. **Ball-by-Ball Data** (2.5+ million rows, 200+ columns per delivery)
2. **Match Data** (Teams, Venues, Results)
3. **Player Data** (Skills, Career Details)
4. **Team Data**

Sample Schema for Ball-by-Ball Data:


## üî• Key Features
**Data Processing**
