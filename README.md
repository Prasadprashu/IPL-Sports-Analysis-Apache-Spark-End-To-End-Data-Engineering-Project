## üìå Overview
This project analyzes **15+ years of IPL match data** to uncover insights about player performance, team strategies, and match dynamics. Built with **PySpark on Databricks**, it includes:
- **ETL pipelines** for processing raw CSV data stored in AWS S3
- Advanced Spark operations (Aggregations, Window Functions, Joins)
- SQL-based analytical queries
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Data quality checks, schema enforcement, and optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Apache Spark 3.5.4** (PySpark API)
- **Databricks** (Notebook Environment)
- **AWS S3** (Data Storage)
- **Python 3.13**
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Spark SQL** (Analytical Queries)
